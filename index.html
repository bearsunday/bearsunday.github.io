    <h3> Resource Orientated Framework </h3>

    <p>
    In BEAR.Sunday `everything` is a REST resource which leads to far simpler design and extensibility.
    Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a 
    resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.

    <h3> Injected Dependency Framework </h3>

    <p>
    In BEAR.Sunday DI is not just a bolt on or handy tool. Everything you code in your application is coded against an interface or abstract class, this means
    that you are never creating a hard dependency on libraries or components that might change in the future. This means you can upgrade with new libraries without changing your core application whatsoever.

    <h3> Aspect Wrapped Framework </h3>

    <p>
    In BEAR.Sunday we recognize that crucial per request flexibility is key to the business of web applications. With AOP included in BEAR testable aspects that are not part of your business logic can wrap your core concerns without them even knowing about it. This means you can write clean domain logic without cluttering it with the likes of caching, logging and authentication code. These will instead be applied elegantly.
