# BEAR.Sunday PHP Framework

> BEAR.Sunday is a resource-oriented PHP framework that combines clean object-oriented design with web principles, emphasizing standards compliance, longevity, high efficiency, and flexibility. It consists of Ray.Di (Dependency Injection), Ray.Aop (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and BEAR.Resource (REST Resources). It uses well-known third party libraries to build web applications with high performance and testability.

BEAR.Sunday provides a structured approach to building web applications centered around REST principles.
