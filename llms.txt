It consists of Ray.Di (Dependency Injection), Ray.Aop (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and BEAR.Resource (REST Resources). It uses well-known third party libraries to build web applications with high performance and testability.

BEAR.Sunday provides a structured approach to building web applications centered around REST principles.
